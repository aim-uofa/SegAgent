## 📖 Description

Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in understanding images but still struggle with pixel-level tasks like segmentation. SegAgent addresses this by introducing a novel **Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT)**, enabling MLLMs to mimic the annotation trajectories of human experts using interactive segmentation tools.

SegAgent effectively leverages these annotation trajectories without requiring architectural modifications or additional implicit tokens. Our approach significantly enhances MLLMs' segmentation and mask refinement abilities, establishing a new paradigm for assessing fine-grained visual understanding and multi-step reasoning.
